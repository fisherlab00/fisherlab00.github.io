My research explores how plant-microbiome interactions in agricultural landscapes can be optimised to produce sustainable food that benefits people and the planet.

Firstly, I aim to uncover how fungicides impact the plant holobiont. Not only do I look at the interactions of fungicides, plants and their microbial counterparts, but I also research the relationships between soil microbial communities and crop growth and health.

Secondly, I am testing whole soil transplants to restore intact microbial communities in degraded agricultural land, helping farmers transition away from the use of agrochemicals and restore soil biodiversity in agroecosystems.

To carry out these aims I use a mixture of field, lab and computational work, namely using bioinformatics approaches to understand fungal (+ bacterial) communities.
