Hi, I'm Harry! I'm broadly interested in fungal genomics and bioinformatics. My research focuses on the use of pangenomes to investigate the emergence and spread of drug resistant fungi.

Alongside this, I help to develop a range of computational tools/pipelines to help with the generation, analysis and dissemination of genomic data on a range of projects.
Projects include, large-scale whole-genome sequencing surveillance , metabarcoding/metagenomic analyses, fungal genome assemblies and automatic report cards for citizen-science.
