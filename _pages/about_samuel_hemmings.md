Hi, I’m Sam, a PhD researcher in the Fisher Lab! I first joined the lab as a Research Assistant and, after a couple of years immersed in the world of fungal pathogens, I stayed on to pursue my PhD.

My background is in investigating how *Aspergillus fumigatus* acquires resistance to antifungal drugs. Previously, I have focused on uncovering novel mechanisms of resistance, and have also developed both laboratory and computational methods for generating high-quality de novo genome assemblies of clinical and environmental fungal isolates using Oxford Nanopore sequencing.

Right now, my research focuses on how people are exposed to fungal bioaerosols in the environment. I’m using a combination of metabarcoding, qPCR, and metagenomics to explore the aeromicrobiome, and I’m particularly interested in how human activities can create environmental hotspots that drive the emergence and spread of antifungal resistance.
