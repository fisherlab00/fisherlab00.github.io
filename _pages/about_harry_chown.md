Hi, I'm Harry! I'm broadly interested in fungal genomics and bioinformatics. My research focuses on using pangenomes to investigate the emergence and spread of drug-resistant fungi.

Alongside this, I contribute to the development of computational tools and pipelines for the generation, analysis, and dissemination of genomic data across various projects. These include large-scale whole-genome sequencing surveillance, metabarcoding and metagenomic analyses, fungal genome assemblies, and automated report cards for citizen science.

When I'm not tapping away at the keyboard, I enjoy hiking and cycling ‚õ∞Ô∏èüö¥
