Javier has a bachelor’s degree in Microbiology from the University of Havana and a master's in Clinical Microbiology from the Institute of Tropical Medicine “Pedro Kourí”. During his master’s, he investigated the antifungal profiles of local isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus and the potential presence of cyp51 polymorphisms associated with antifungal resistance. 

He is currently pursuing a PhD in Microbiology, with specialization in bioinformatics and biostatistics. His research focuses on how environmental factors shape genetic variation in _Candida albicans_ and _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and how fungal diversity impacts human health. 

In his free time, he loves to go hiking or play the guitar.
