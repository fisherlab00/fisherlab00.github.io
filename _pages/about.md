Professor Matthew Fisher leads research into the biology and evolution of emerging fungal pathogens. His team investigates how environmental change, human activity, and evolutionary processes are driving a global rise in fungal diseases affecting humans, wildlife, and plants.

Fungal pathogens often emerge from natural ecosystems, with wildlife acting as reservoirs for new infectious diseases. At the same time, human-driven factors—such as environmental disruption, global trade, and widespread antifungal use—are accelerating the spread and adaptation of these pathogens, leading to drug resistance and outbreaks in new regions.

The Fisher Lab uses genomic, epidemiological, ecological, and experimental approaches to understand the dynamics of fungal disease emergence and to develop better tools for detection and control.
