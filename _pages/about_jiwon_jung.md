Jiwon Jung is currently an MRes student in Biomedical Research (Microbiome in Health and Disease) at Imperial College London. She joined the Fisher Lab in March 2025, where she is currently conducting her Masterâ€™s research project.
 
She completed her undergraduate studies in Biology in South Korea. After graduating, she worked as a research intern at the Natural Product Informatics Research Centre at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), where she took part in large-scale experiments and gained experience with various laboratory techniques. This experience strengthened her interest in microbes and their role in human health, a field she is now exploring in greater depth through postgraduate study. Her current research focuses on the diversity of airborne fungi within the context of bioaerosols and their potential impact on human health.
